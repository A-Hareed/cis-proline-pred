# Using Machine Learning to predict Cis/trans-proline:

ML tools like Weka and XGBoost are used to train the binary classifier to predict wether a amino acids attached to prolines have cis (0 degree)
omega-angle (Ï‰) or trans (180 deree).

To do this, a protein dataset is built using a file listing all PDB chains used:

```
# see protein dataset 
less pdb/cullpdb_pc25.0_res0.0-3.0_noBrks_noDsdr_len40-10000_R0.25_Xray_d2021_06_05_chains3940
```

Using the script `scripts/pdb_database_build.sh`, the correct protein chains are extracted and the torsion angles are extracted into a text file using
BiopTools' pdbtorsions:
```
